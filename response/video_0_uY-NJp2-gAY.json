director of enforcement is stepping down what's happening here let's get into it hey everybody welcome into the thinking crypto podcast your home for cryptocurrency news and interviews I'm your host Tony Edward on your way in please hit that subscribe button as well as a thumbs up button and leave a comment below if you're listening on a podcast platform such as Spotify or apple please leave a five-star rating and review folks the breaking news the SEC has filed a notice of appeal of judge torres's ruling in the Ripple lawsuit now remember judge Torres ruled that secondary market sales of xrp are not Securities and that the token itself intrinsically is not a security however she said the institutional sales do count as Securities transactions because there's a contract however the ruling that the token itself intrinsically is not a security and secondary market sales like on exchanges are not Securities was the big line share of the victory uh in this lawsuit for Ripple uh yes the SEC won part of it but that not so much because it didn't impact the broader markets that was just institutional sales well the SEC is definitely trying to appeal judge Taurus's ruling on the secondary market sales now we had an idea that this may happen I've been covering it on the podcast in my newsletter and so forth and there's a lot to cover here so let me share what different folks are saying first up Ripple CEO Bri garlinghouse he tweeted if genser and the SEC were rational they would have moved on from this case long ago it certainly hasn't protected investors and instead has damaged The credibility and reputation of the SEC somehow they still haven't gotten the message they lost on everything that matters Ripple the crypto industry and the rule of law have already prevailed while we'll fight in court for as long as we need to uh let's be clear xrp status as a non-security is the law of the land and that does not change even in the face of this misguided and infuriating appeal remember when the SEC tried unsuccessfully to file an interlocutory appeal they made clear they had no intention of challenging xrp status as a non-security so folks despite this appeal the law of the land today and until the Court's rule again is that xrp is not a security so I don't think this should cause any issues as far as exchanges listing xrp I think it's just going to remain as is because majority of the industry is in a legal battle already with the SEC right and many of the folks battling the SEC like coinbase Kraken and so forth are using judge Taurus's ruling to fight back the SEC so I don't think we're going to see any delisting of xrp like we saw in 2020 we are in a completely different environment people are not scared anymore they've already got their Wells notices and lawsuits and the industry is punching back counter suing as well as proactively suing even if they haven't gotten anything from the SEC so very different environment and I don't expect xrp to be delisted I don't anticipate any major effects on the price unless once again there's some new ruling from the courts but this thing looks like it's just going to continue on and on uh into another year or years it could certainly be that way and I'll give you some details here Ripple's Chief legal officer steuart Alara said they are think about cross appealing so he says the sec's division to appeal is disappointing but not surprising this just prolongs what's already a complete embarrassment for the agency the court already rejected the sec's suggestion that Ripple acted recklessly and there were no allegations of Fraud and of course there were no victims or losses instead of faithfully applying the law the agency under this chair continues to engage in litigation Warfare against the industry we are evaluating whether to file cross appeal either way the sec's lawsuit has been irrational and misguided from the start and we're ready to prove that yet again in the appell court once again taking the lead for the industry uh number three he says coincidence that the sec's enforcement director announced his resignation about an hour before this I'll get to that later in the podcast let me highlight something else here uh elor ter of Fox Business says uh Ripple is considering a cross appeal this means Ripple could choose to to file an appeal on Judge Taurus's ruling on institutional sales or on the penalty of $125 million both appeals would stay wrapped up in one second circuit case if Ripple does file an appeal it has 14 days to do it and the clock starts tomorrow so the SEC wants to play these games Ripple will play the game as well and appeal either the penalty amount or the institutional sales so once again this thing is not going to wrap up uh in in month or so this thing is going to go for the Long Haul again but I think the SEC uh lost the majority of this the Optics are bad for genser and the SEC with with all these Congressional hearings all these lawsuits and the election is right around the corner so um I am not concerned about this appeal because I anticipated it might happen and as stated we are in a very different environment than we were in 2020 what is a cause for concern is that the SEC will most likely block the xrp ETF bitwise just yesterday we talked about it they filed for an ETF that's Dead on Arrival just like the salana ETF salana has mentioned in many of these lawsuits such as coinbase Kraken and so forth and that's why it was withdrawn by the folks at vanx so uh one thing I wanted to highlight Elanor Tera to Fox Business uh found another ETF filing done by Canary capital I mentioned to you guys yesterday Canary Capital launched an harar trust for institutional investors so you're seeing uh these different institutional investors uh see the demand for xrp and uh it was a great find by Eleanor that another investment firm was trying to get this xrp ETF going now Attorney Fred rasoli who I will have on the podcast tomorrow to talk about all of this he's obviously a legal expert and he can break all of this down better for all of us he says SEC appeals Ripple will cross appeal sec's company ending district court cases against coinbase and Kraken continue life continues don't freak out but if you are a crypto single issue us voter you absolutely cannot vote for the Harris Walt ticket there is no reset can't argue with him there folks and once again I'll have him on tomorrow to uh break down this appeal and what may happen next now in a very surprising move gerb gral uh he's another scumbag gser crony director of the division of enforcement will depart the agency effective October 11th that is very strange and it's akin to what Jay Clayton did make a scumbag move right file this appeal and then run out the door Jay Clayton filed the lawsuit next day I'm out the door right uh that is what could be happening here so he's probably trying to save himself and and I don't know who's going to replace him and whatever it is but actually they said here upon M Mr gal's departure Sanjay wadwa the division's deputy director will serve as the acting director so they don't really have anybody lined up here so something is just strange once again it's like the the uh Jay Clayton situation um Tom memer says SEC director of enforcement GRE wall encouraged lawlessness and Chaos at Gary ganser's SEC he even admitted it to us on record in 2022 good to see him packing his bags let's hope Gary genser will be out of there soon now Jake traversi um gave some great thoughts on the director leaving he says it's not normal for an SEC enforcement director to get disappeared like this gone on 9 days notice would no replacement lined up perhaps the inevitable end to a campaign of unlawful harassment and misrepresentation resulting in many embarrassing defeats in court bye peace but look I don't trust Gary we got to wait and see but this is very strange and maybe like I said it's it's akin to uh Jay Clayton's move right do do a scumbag move and then run out the door now guys I know a lot of negative news there right not great news but um we got some positive things happening in Congress more Democrat members of Congress are supporting crypto representative Rana one of the top Democrats who I've had on the podcast uh he's the first Democrat Congressman to endorse a strategic Bitcoin Reserve he says Bitcoin has been seized by the US government should be used as a strategic Reserve asset given its potential for appreciation and uh this is really great to see but we need to hear it from who kamla Harris but things are not looking good for her from a cryto cryto standpoint uh I'm happy you have folks in the house and the Senate that are are doing embracing crypto on the Democrat side but until the head of the snake says it I don't I can't you know fully support uh the Harris camp on on this stuff because look you're I mean come on you're attacking the hell out of crypto and trying to stifle Innovation so uh pretty crazy but once again guys I'm optimistic that uh things are going to move in the Congress where we can get legislation through remember to fit 21 Bill moved out of the house with the support of 71 Democrats uh Dennis Porter who heads up the Satoshi act fund tweeted out today big things coming for Bitcoin in the USA this month is going to set the foundation for Americans to witness the true bipartisan and unifying nature of Bitcoin Bitcoin is winning in the United States so uh we could see some legislation go through I don't know I'm going to try to get him on the podcast to get details now before we go further uh be sure to check out our sponsor bitgo which is one of the top tier crypto custodians in the market guys bitgo is headed up by Mike belelli who's a web 1.0 and 2.0 Legend uh bitgo works with many big companies such as bitstamp exchange panta Capital 21 shares soie uh they help to custody some of the assets for the Bitcoin

he talking about well he was recently interviewed by decrypt where he said the uh fit 21 bill could make it out of the senate or get through the Senate uh during the lame duck session later this year fingers crossed that happens folks that would be a big win because if you can get it out of the Senate then it can make its way to a new president and be put into law so let's hope this happens this could really help in building momentum for the bull market guys and here's another big win Ki which is a prediction Market uh Crypt base they won their appeal where uh US presidential election markets are illegal remember poly Market is doing the same thing so this is a a big win and and uh it's something Elizabeth Warner was trying to shut down so uh you guys know what to do if you're in the state of Massachusetts vote for John Deon kick out Elizabeth Warren if you're not in the state of Massachusetts donate to John Deon guys that's the news I know the xrp news regarding the sec's appeal really sucks it's bad news but uh I once again I'm not worried because it's a very different environment I don't believe any companies are going to delist xrp especially you had grayscale just launch a trump a lot of other companies trying to get ETFs and so forth but I do think the ETFs are not going to make it h honestly because of what's happening but the this shouldn't affect xrp's trading unless there's some Mass D listing which I don't think is going to happen all right guys be sure to leave your comments below hit the Thumbs Up Button be sure to sign up for my free email newsletter 100%
