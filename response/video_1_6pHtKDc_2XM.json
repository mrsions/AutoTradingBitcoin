hello everyone Gareth Solway discusses the fed's latest rate cut and its impact on inflation economic growth and markets Solway updates his outlook on stocks gold Bitcoin subscribe now hit that Bell icon and embark on an enriching journey toward financial success let's unlock the potential of these markets together and pave the way for a brighter financial future welcome aboard Bitcoin is back above $60,000 into Q4 having delivered a September more successful than any in the past decade BTC price action has joined that of United States equities Conjuring an impressive comeback from lows in early August can the good times continue via a classic October while btcusd has greeted the new month with more of a side than a bang the foundations are arguably in place to attack not only upside resistance but it's $ 73,800 all-time high fed watch tool right now we're look right now we're in November let's flip over to June no let's do July okay let's do like middle of summer next year we're looking at a significant probability or big most of the probability lies in the 275 basis point to 325 distribution okay so right now uh the current Target is 475 to 500 so we're looking at exactly a 200 basis point cut from today in the next year or so now do you think that is a little bit aggressive given that the FED is projecting three three and a quarter 3.4 is their median dotplot expectation I I know some economists don't think that dotplot is reliable when forecasting uh but that is what Powell said so what do you think about uh this expectation yeah so I I also agree I think I think it's very unreliable um I think that for the most part the markets ceue off of what the FED says and then they obviously extrapolate out but to me you're looking at an economy that is going to slowly weaken right if we look at the various metrics here we have the yield curve has now uninverted if you look at the yield curve what happens it un inverts 3 to six months later we have a recession and that's been historic the norm pretty much even going into Co it was briefly inverted just before Co hit and so we have to say that okay by the end of this year to the first quarter of 2025 that's when your recession hits if you go by the data and it's very important to go by the data in addition if we take a look here and if I can show my chart I want to show you the 10year yield look at what we have on this it's fantastic so we have gone to a point where we are now coming down on the 10year and I have major technical support look at this High here right through these lows this up slope sloping trend line these are merging around 3 to 3.25% so for me I'm looking at this is where the FED funds levels are going to be where we're going to come down to on interest rates now that kind of puts it in the range but still the key to understand here is that we're likely going to see a recession the FED is going to want to cut more but I'm fearful that if they cut too much it's going to Kickstart the inflation gauge again and I am worried about stagflation I do think stagflation is a very possible outcome here not in the near term no one's going to talk about it for a little while here because we've seen the the numbers come down on inflation pce came down cpis come down but I do worry that the FED being so aggressive on these Cuts you're going to see inflation start to move up but you're not going to see the economic growth that you're hoping to get why would we have inflation move up if the consumer spending is going to slow down like you said earlier yeah so so number one we have to look back to the 70s when this this happened right so in the 70s this was the last time you saw this kind of stagflation type of focus where we did see inflation moving up even when the economy was slowing and my fear is this is that you're getting to a point where the debt is going to start to matter so you have 33 trillion 30 whatever it is trillion dollars in debt now for the US government the FED at some point when we get in recession they're they're going to start to make money even easier and I do worry that these implications are going to force inflation to uptick just a little bit which is going to basically hog tie the Federal Reserve from continuing to lower rates back to where everyone's hoping and you know mortgage players and and interest rates the thought process is hey they could go back to where covid was you know at zero or or just around those areas I don't see that happening and I do worry that that's going to be the outcome here we're going to see interest rates coming down but stopping because inflation begins to kick up again and then you have a weak economy that can't be stimulated out because inflation is starting to push up you think make maybe the market is anticip ating lower inflation into next year because the FED funds rate Futures is projecting a much lower fed funds rate and I think that's right I think I think the market is even thinking about well maybe we'll go into deflation right because if you look at the PC data it's coming down so quickly that heck it could be deflationary I don't buy that I think we get lower to 2% on inflation it starts to become stagnant the FED starts cutting even more because the economy slows and that starts to Kickstart inflation again even with a slowing economy so what's your outlook for the 10year yield going to 2025 yeah so so right now the 10year yield looking like that 3% to three and a quarter percent level I think that's going to be the key zone right in here so you're looking at this as being your first major technical support if it breaks that then things get really nasty and what we could look at here is if we zoom out on this chart on the 10year and go back to 1995 there's a really amazing trend line here this would be kind of a worst case scenario for yields in terms of downside notice again you have a level here here where we take this high this high this high and right through here and that would be your next Target zone of a move to the downside that would take us below so this is your first Target and then if that breaks you get here but I don't anticipate it getting that low again that would be around 2% that would be kind of a worst case scenario and I think we'd have to be in a pretty bad recession and not see that inflationary pressure to get yields that low okay well that means would you be bullish on bonds then if you think yeah I think it's a safety head you have to be bullish on gold you have to be bullish on bonds um you have to basically look for these places like when you have utilities doing well and defensive names if the economy starts to tank and we do see any sort of sellouts sell-offs in the Walmarts the money is not going to necessarily choose tech stocks it's going to still have to be invested but likely heading to other areas like bonds and gold well by the way let's talk about gold for just a minute earlier in the year you're on the show you had call higher gold price I believe you said $2,500 could have been the target I think at the time it was $2,000 or were 25500 move on $2,000 seemed like a pretty big deal at the time 25% is not common for a year for gold it surpassed that uh we're almost at 2 260 uh uh 2655 is my is my latest reading 2700 we're close to that level uh is this overbought for you yes short term it is and in fact I'm short gold right now now please understand everyone watching at home I was a bull at the start of the year when we were at 2000 on your show in fact I said hey guys my target is $230 we've gotten there and a and even gone past it per the analysis and that was a beautiful trade like you said I was called crazy I people said hey gold is is over with no one wants to be in Gold anymore I love buying things when people say that so check this out we have the chart of gold I'm using a logarithmic chart again so we look at the logarithmic we look back to the 1980 High we connect that to the 2007 bull market high and look at what we just tagged on gold so for me as a shorter term trade I'm short gold here for a pullback to 2500 at which point I plan to flip it over as my mid to longterm remains bullish to 3,000 being hit next year in 2025 so 3,000 Target next year but in the short term I'm expecting a pullback and we've actually started to see it if we flip over to our daily chart you can see right into that level look at that beautiful the charts just work their magic we're starting to see a pullback here's your target zone right here this is around 2500 we can see how this was kind of a a shelf right here then it broke out we should retrace right back into that level before the next Bull move comes in are you looking at potentially $3,000 soon yeah so I think it I don't think it'll be until 2025 probably mid to late 20125 but yeah there's really no reason why gold will not go up unless Elon Musk starts mining on asteroids in the near term um that's the only way I would get bearish on gold because we have to remember that you have debt in the in the political system right the US debt just keeps going up there's not one candidate for president that's even talking about reducing spending and remember when you have a great economy that's when governments are supposed to pay down the debt because they're bringing in more tax revenue instead our government for the I mean really for a long time now has just been spending spending spending the problem is if we go into a recession like I think they're going to need to spend even more to stimulate us out of that recession I don't even know if it's going to be possible but you can't go into fiscal austerity when you have a recession I mean that's just going to make us go into a depression and so that debt is going to keep going up and that's going to make gold a valuable asset to diversify away and by the way Bitcoin too I just think with Bitcoin being correlated to the stock market you probably run the risk of 20 30% Corrections that could bring it much much lower before you have that next up move the Bitcoin price has been selling off though and uh this is kind of uh strange because um historically it's been tracking the NASDAQ but the it's just been diverging um in the last um basically basically week or so but I'll let you comment on that yeah yeah so and what we're seeing here guys is Bitcoin right in front of you and so Bitcoin has been tracking the equity markets very very closely today we are seeing a little weakness but a bigger selloff in Bitcoin This concerns me because again this should be the market where bitcoin's making new all-time highs with the stock market making new all-time highs so while this bigger channel is a bullish Channel you know the key again is you know if the Market's dumped does it come back in here I would say that as long as you hold 50 to 49,000 this support number one and two here you buy these levels if this breaks stop out right away because I honestly think if this stock market collapses you're going to go a lot lower we could be talking even into the low 30,000 range I will be a heavy buyer in the 30,000 range though if we get there again I love Bitcoin longterm midterm it's just the stock market dependency is very concerning to me because people are fickle right you have these new ETFs spot ETFs lots of retail investors that really weren't in Bitcoin prior are in if they get scared they dump and Bitcoin goes down wait sorry why why would it go to 30,000 from this point that's a 50% decline uh yeah yep so so number one 50% Corrections in Bitcoin are standard that's standard for Bare markets if it goes into a bare Market flush 50% is pretty much your run-of-the-mill but the key is I'm a technical Trader so if we look at this level right here the 52 to 49,000 level if those break there's not a lot of major support until the low 30s so this level must hold if you're bull case if you're a bull right now and you see Bitcoin dumping out to the low 50s it's got to hold that if it breaks Watch Out Below what about to the upside is there um is there a ceiling where if it breaks above that we're in a bull market yes yes so see this upper resistance line right here this parallel line so if you if price can get above there and confirm you're probably headed to 100,000 uh sorry where is that again 70,000 so basically 69 68,000 if you get above there I think money just flocks in and it rips higher and I think within three three to four months you could be at 100K okay uh I I'm curious as to why Bitcoin just B the charge did not sustain its uh pre- alltime High which is earlier in the year it reached 70,000 um which beat the last alltime High a couple years ago and it just stalled there yeah it's a great question great question and I think I think this is where people are so so one of the things to keep in mind is that we've seen utilities you were mentioning it earlier we've seen defensive names start to take off and run well Bitcoin is probably the least defensive name out there of an asset class crypto right and so I think that's why Bitcoin has struggled is because even though tech stocks and the markets are making new all-time highs the markets are not being led by you know Microsoft or Nvidia anymore right they're being led by the the Walmarts like you said Walmart Costco Eli Lily like these are much more defensive names and that doesn't jive with investing in Bitcoin and so I think Bitcoin has seen some money move away from it for defensive names and that's kept it from making new all-time highs here in the short term thank you for watching the interview highlights of Gareth Solway if o you
